# 🪑 Dinner Guest Matcher – Two Pointers Algorithm

## 🧠 Project Objective

This project demonstrates the use of the **two pointers algorithm** to efficiently find the **first pair of guests** whose names start with the **same letter**.

---

## 📋 Problem Description

You are organizing a dinner party, and you have a guest list sorted alphabetically. Some guests would prefer to sit next to others whose names begin with the **same letter**.

Your task is to write a program that **quickly finds the first pair** of guests who can sit together based on this rule.

## 🚀 How the Algorithm Works

We use the **two-pointer technique** to solve this efficiently:

1. Start with one pointer at the beginning of the list.
2. Place the second pointer at the next position.
3. Compare the **first letters** of both names.
4. If the initials **match**, return the pair of names.
5. If they **don’t match**, move both pointers forward.
6. Continue until a match is found or the end of the list is reached.

## 🔍 Why use two pointers algorithm?
- Reduce time complexity from nested loops (O(n2)) to O(n)
- Improve readability and performance

## 🧩 Future improvements 

- Implement Llook for duplicates in user lists 
- Verify two list of products
- Verifi if a given message is a palindrome 
- Find overlapsed time intervals in a calendar 
- Verify available time slots in a calendar
- Delete duplicate elements
- Sync files
- Identify missing elements
